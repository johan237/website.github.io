Hello, my name is Kemmegne Tchassem Johan. I am a master research student at the University of Sherbrooke. 


My research project is on building an intelligent system capable of evaluating (and quantifying) dangerous state when someone is cooking depending on the user profile and cooking conditions and giving him the best contextual assistance. This project is developed at Laboratoire DOMUS, a research lab focusing on building assistive technologies especially for older adults and people having cognitive or physical issues. 


I have already written an article : [not-yet-published]. This article present a four-based fuzzy system and adaptive framework to evaluate and quantify danger when someone is cooking such that the system adapts to user actions and evolves with time.


I am currently working on the assistance which will be provided through the usage of LLMs for refined actions depending on user specificities. 


After my master's degree, I wish to work in data science and particularly LLMs but I am open to work on any challenging and impactful projects at the intersection of both engineering and research.
